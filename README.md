# ShopConnect E-commerce Platform

This repository contains the implementation of **ShopConnect**, a robust e-commerce platform developed as part of the Web Technologies course (Summer 2023-24) at AIUB. The platform is designed to serve three distinct user roles: **Admin**, **Merchants**, and **Customers**. Each role is assigned specific features, ensuring a seamless and secure environment for product management, ordering, and user interactions.

## Key Features:

- **Admin**: Admins hold the highest control over the platform, allowing them to manage users, merchants, and products. They can:
  - Add, view, update, and delete products.
  - Manage user accounts (customers and merchants).
  - Oversee merchant activity and product listings.

- **Merchants**: Merchants manage their own products and orders. They can:
  - Add, view, update, and delete products.
  - View and manage customer orders related to their products.
  
- **Customers**: Customers can explore the product catalog, place orders, and manage their profiles. They can:
  - View all products.
  - Place and track orders.
  - View order history and update account information.

## Technologies:
The project follows the **MVC** architecture, providing a clear separation between the interface, logic, and database operations. The system includes the following features:
- **Login and Registration** for all users.
- **Profile Management** for viewing and updating personal details.
- **Order Management** for merchants and customers, ensuring smooth transaction and order tracking.
- **Responsive Design** using **Bootstrap** for an optimized user experience.

## Installation:
Clone the repository and follow the setup instructions provided in the documentation to get the platform running locally.
